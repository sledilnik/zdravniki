This leaves many patients without the basic right of access to a personal GP. In the Scientific association Tracker, we imported the data that was publicly available every 15 days in a spreadsheet that was not user friendly into our portal and allowed users to suggest corrections for faulty data in real time. This gave patients seeking primary care user-friendly and up-to-date information."
